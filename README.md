WinBall Survivor is a game I made for my Game Design (MWD 230) final project. It includes several standard assets and UI kits..

  - Navigate to the winball-survivor folder
  - Download .zip file
  - Magic

You can also:
  - Go to the 'Builds' folder
  - Download the macOS/Windows executable
  - Go to [my website](http://winball.tushariyer.co) to play online

### Objective
----
The objective of this game is to get to the WinBall. You have spawned on an unfamiliar terrain and you are dying. Your health is falling and only the WinBall can help you. Use the HealthPacks along the way to bolster your reserves. Be careful not to traverse over cliffs, or you might not have enough health to make it back up.

### Console Output in Unity
----
From this we can see the ```console``` output that occurs during gameplay. I'm actually really happy to be able to say that the game runs without any warnings at all! the ```Debug.Log();``` statements are written in to various classes and are triggered when certain events fire. If you open the project in Unity and test, you'll see how the console notifies you of the coordinates at which the enemies/healthpacks spawn. They're visisble on the minimap as well!

### Controls
----
The controls are fairly simple. Use the ```W``` ```A``` ```S``` ```D``` keys to navigate and strafe. Your mouse controls directional input. Use ```Space``` to jump and ```Shift``` to sprint.

### Enemies
----

We're (by we're, I mean me) proud to state that this game has three kinds of enemies. 
> A Sentry, which is an enemy that stays in one spot and looks at you. It will not attack, lest you enter its 15 foot radius. Then God help you.
> A Passive enemy, which roams the land aimlessly. This enemy just wants to be alone, and won't hurt you unless you touch it. Then it's your fault. Don't come to me and complain.
> An Aggressive enemy; who randomly goes about the terrain. Don't be fooled, these look similar to the Passive Enemies but have a slightly darker side (get it? They're all black). If these see you, they will follow you. They will find you, and they will kill you. :)

### Tech
----
WinBall Survivor uses a couple of open source assets to work:

* Unity's Default asset kit
* Unity's UI/Cinematic Effects & WaterFX
* Campfire [Free]
* IslandAssets [Free]

And of course WinBall itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/tushariyer)
on GitHub.

### Installation
----
WinBall requires you to download the executable and double-click.
